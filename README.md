** Prime clock

* Just a test to learn some basics in Python.

This clock only shows time when the time seen as an integer is a prime number.

First version only prints time in console.
Second one creates a pygame window to show the clock.

The font used in second version is DSEG7Classic-Regular.ttf from spiroplot found <a href=https://github.com/rbtdev/spiroplot/blob/master/fonts/DSEG7/Classic/DSEG7Classic-Regular.ttf>here</a>
